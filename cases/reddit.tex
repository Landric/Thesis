1) yes, yes you can. Whether that referendum actually leads to anything is another story. In saying that, if we voted for independence and then weren't allowed to by Westminster there would be civil war in some shape or form.

2) Scotland would have a much easier time getting in than Ukraine, for instance. We already follow all of the policies and regulations to the letter.

3) She is, but she's *our* cunt and I trust her/the SNP a hell of a lot more than the other cunts playing political panto in London.

> The Scottish First Minister and SNP leader said if England voted to leave the EU while Scotland voted to remain there would be an &quot;Inescapable&quot; shift in public opinion towards independence to guarantee the country&#039;s continued EU membership.

> &quot;If, a couple of years later, we find ourselves, having voted to stay in the EU, being taken out against our will, I think there will be many people - including people who voted No in 2014 - who would say the only way to guarantee our EU membership is to be independent."

> Ms Sturgeon acknowledged that an independent Scotland in the EU would have to negotiate its border arrangements if the remainder of the UK was outside the EU. She added that said she has &quot;No proposals&quot; to use her new devolved powers to top up benefits for migrants, but said EU migrants have had a positive impact on the UK economy.

the snp claimed labour would need them to govern, and that scotland would have the sway over a future labour government. 

great for her home audience, but the tories used it to make labour look like their puppet- a british parliament working for scotland. 

so scotland gets all those mps but as you say, not enough to decide any policies AND they ensured a tory victory.

This is getting beyond a joke with this Independence crap now, The SNP and more specifically Sturgeon are looking for just about any excuse to force through another Independence vote.

The majority voted no and were vindicated in that vote when it was  shown later that the SNPs predictions for North Sea oil were out massively (based on oil being $100+ per barrel) The SNP predictions for 2016/17 Oil revenue was £8 billion, That number is now as low as £500 million.

It's got so bad with the SNP incessant talk of another independence vote David Cameron could be seen eating a Tunnock's Teacake and Sturgeon would demand an independence vote, Maybe she should spend more of her time focused on the important politics for Scotland and not this ridiculous idiotic blind drive towards an independence that the majority of Scots have already said no to.

Edit: Here come the downvotes by the hardcore independence mentalists who can never see any bad in what the SNP do as long they get their Freeeeeddooooommmm.

To pretend that Brexit wouldn't effect Scotland is ridiculous. To believe that the leader of the SNP wouldn't mention Independence, over concerns for what Brexit would do to Scotland, is also ridiculous.
