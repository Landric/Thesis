What I don't get is this. The FBI has connections everywhere, they get things done that most other organisation can't get done, but they can not hack a bloody iPhone??  I find that somehow hard to believe. 

And here is why. I know an address here in London where every hard drive can be decoded and all the data copied to another external hard drive. 
And how do I know that place?? I googled data recovery when my hard drive gave up and everything was still on it.

yes, but in this case, they, the fbi, want apple to create a backdoor app so that they, the fbi, dont have to get apple to unlock a phone for them ever again. i will be secure in my person and my papers. a cell phone is considered papers in this electronic age. and dont forget, they will have to try to reverse engineer anything. which is another reason, that apple wont make a back door.

I get apple is hypocritical. That isn't a factor in my decision to support their stance on this issue. I hate terrorists and want them caught. But the idea that if we just give up more rights it will bring safety is ludicrous. We know that isn't true by the fact we have had many security breaches and terrorist attacks since 9/11. So they win if we change who we are in order to stop them.

Austin Centolella maybe they are complacent and involved in the jihad network more than we are supposed to know those apple-ites. Obviously they are involved with selling items to known threats in the world. We know that much is truth. How about arresting the CEOs who are involved with making it easier for the ongoing muslim threats against us - as they sell them wares and are making money from them.

Apple are more worried about the cost of a new security system.  Apple iphone system is one of the devices that the US goverment apparently use to spy on people.  Data protection act?.  The security Mcafee team claim they could crack the code in three weeks or Mcafee will eat his shoe on live tv...  Either way Apple woud have to change their whole system of security.   Why did nothing of interest pop up on the FBI radar if these people had connections to terrorists in the first place, especially if the FBI get accused of spying all the time?   What does this tell us about US security?

This is all they wanted done.  And on this phone ONLY. Taken from the Washington Post. The showdown between Apple and the government arises out of the FBI’s inability to recover data from Farook’s phone, especially for the weeks prior to the attack. The Justice Department on Tuesday got a federal judge to order Apple to build software to override an auto-wipe feature on the phone that deletes data after 10 failed tries to enter a password. The FBI could then try to crack the phone’s password by “brute force,” making many attempts without risking the wiping of the data.

Whether a customer of apple phone is a terrorist or not, without a court order to unlock it is a criminal offense.  unlocking it is easy but the fbi must be certain as to whose phones they are ordering apple to unlock. This could be the reason why apple stands firm on its decision not to do it or prolly was warned by customers not to hack into their privacy. Dumb morons are just that dumb morons.

"At this point, what difference does it make"?    The crime happened months ago.  The killers are DEAD.   The whole "investigation" is a massive WASTE of OUR money.   The FBI should spend their time investigating and stopping the NEXT Muslim terrorist attack.

Wonder how many of the "nothing to hide" people are willing to leave their homes back door unlocked, along with removing all the curtains and shades  from their windows. Then add some video cameras to every room of their home and stream it to the web with your home address pinned to it.  Are you comfortable with it? Even with not telling anyone you have all that out there? 

If you honestly believe you have nothing to hide, than you have no idea what you yourself are worth. All your information is accessible through your phone. Everything. All your apps, passwords, locations, people you call. Your camera, your microphone, bank accounts, emails, social media. 

I'm sorry, I like my privacy more than that. I prefer to lock my back door and only allow those I say in. 

Apple giving out a key to the back door of your phone is the equivalent of the bank, or your landlord, giving some stranger the key to the back door of your home. How is that so hard to realize?

They don't have a problem retrieving information from the phone. The FBI want access to all phones which not only goes against privacy laws but will inevitably create a vulnerability in the software open for hackers to exploit. And what really is the point as the likes of Samsung won't be open to such a request. It will murder apples numbers why would they do it?
