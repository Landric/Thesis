The reason I will not vote for TRUMP is because he is too much like ME and I know how dangerous I would be if I was President. Trump appeals to everything that I am, that is Bad . When I hear him speaking for most of what he says its like hes speaking whats in my head and when i am angry there is a lot going on in my head that if I acted on would hurt a lot of people.

I'm trying to Change that part of me and I am trying to hold back those emotional responses. If Trump is President he will release and encourage every bad thing in me. He is like the figurative devil on my shoulders, imagine voting for and electing that little small voice.

Donald Trump is the embodiment of every negative trait and character flaw that I and his supporters have. He is a freaking mirror of all our Character flaws and everything that's bad about us that needs to Change. Unfortunate for America Donald Trump and Ted CRUZ are going to be the next Administrative leaders Ted might very well become the figurative good Angel on our shoulder. Can you imagine what that would look like. I can see it and it actually scares me.

Trump speaks to every negative trait in me. He appeals to my anger and everything in me that's negative. If he becomes president he will represent every weak flaw in me that I am trying so , so very hard to change. Voting for Trump would be the most irresponsible thing I could ever do.

Just because Donald says what most of us who like him think, does not justify voting for him. The only good thing about Trump is that he is not a Politician. He is not apart of the good Ol' boys club. Other than that there is not too much left. My Educated opinion is Trump will only make the situation worse, as would anyone who makes decisions based on Anger. Do we need a leader like that? Will that really make America Great Again?

Trump by his folly will only strengthen and empower an enemy that already is blind by there own fury and there own anger there own leaders who speak to the worst parts of them. An enemy that is blinded to how they are being used and manipulated by there own emotional manipulators. When will it ever stop. We need a leader that can answer that Question and actually Implement a plan that can bring peace to everyone involved.

Donald Trump is going to be the next President and I guarantee that within 6 months of him being in office EVERYONE that voted for him will sorrowfully regret having done so. Only then will you realize how irresponsible it is to respond in anger to this very messed up situation. And by then it will be too freaking late.

I might be wrong about Ted Cruz....

Interesting times we live in. I'd really like to see Trump and Sanders win their respective party's nomination. I think they might both force our two political parties to reform and produce better candidates. It'd be nice to see them shake up DC too, they're both political outsiders and it seems most establishment politicians aren't very fond of either of them.

You just ran a article on BBC 24, around 15 minutes ago, regarding Apple fighting the FBI over the court ruling to unblock the iPhone of the killer Syed Rizwan Farook. The article makes a terribly gaffe in it. It shows a clip of Mark Zuckerburg speaking on this subject, but a caption came up underneath stating' Donald Trump - Facebook CEO'. It then immediately shows a clip of Donald Trump speaking on this subject, correctly captioned as 'Donald Trump - Republican Presidential Candidate'. It is bad enough that Mr Trump is having success in his bid, as I consider some of his comments at times to be ugly, unwanted and crass. But to now having top news agencies make glaring blunders in editing their articles and mistakenly give Mr Trump credit for being CEO of Facebook, really takes the biscuit!

Ted Cruz Unites, leads, apologizes for minor faults, accepts responsible. A true conservative leader.  Trumps doesn't accept responsibility, divides groups, and almost never apologizes. Nothing to add only subtracts. Trumps obviously has many Non-Leader liabilities.

 ... & This country is going to hell in a golden woven basket. Lol Hey it's not over to the foul mouthed boy sings. But until that day it's better to laugh than cry.
For Trump's insults the USA needs a good bar of American made soap. "Guard the door of your lips."  So Trump said that he could "murder" someone? My supporters are loyal"(Paraphrasing) I like comedy, but why even joke about violence?And he should apologize for calling THE GREAT POPE FRANCIS "DISGRACEFUL",  that would be nice. And bring more respect for himself, Roman Catholics & the Great USA.

CRUZ 2016🇺🇸  Conservative fairness & unity.  America First.  Security & Constitution. 

Tired of Trumps Tantrums & Tactics??   Donald Trump is an angry divisive man with some money in an wannabe Statesman's empty suit. He is not a Unifier in these United States of America, he's a divider.  
Petty politics AA ball. Trump better put on his baseball cap again, the big leagues are next.
Here's a defense & idea, the press/media is a double edge sword. What's old is new, new old. Very easily you can find current & archived negative press stories about Trump the last 50 yrs. there must be plenty plenty of NY press articles about Trump divorces, evictions, play boying, politician games, casino shenanigans, lawsuits, at least one thousand, 1000 Trump Wrongdoings, lies, and just not nice behavior. Have a team find them, highlight, word search the word "lie","stole","lawsuits" briefly in each of the one thousand articles found. Lol. Unleash it on block all at once on your website & everywhere, the press.  And prove that he(Trump) is the liar, wrong doer, not nice person. And archived anti Trump 1000 Article Trump media FACTUAL review. I'd do it, just an idea.

CRUZ 2016🇺🇸 Leadership.
Accountability, Resolve. More Action, Less Talk.
Ted Cruz 2016🇺🇸 A Proven Advocate for Freedom. Getting results. Policy Results & discourse. Understsnding the party not attacking it. Bringing the Conservative Republican Party together, not dividing it. 
   -Trump: No track record. Proven Insults. -

Americans don't want a strong leader, they want a good one. 
Ted Cruz 2016😊 Building Bridges Before Walls.  Trust Ted you won't be fired! Trust Ted, he won't fire you.  Ted Terrific.

For CRUZ 2016🇺🇸 & supporters::
     -"Never, Never, Never give up."
       Winston Churchill

For Trump & supporters:
     "Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen."-  
      Winston Churchill

The positive thing about him is he isn't just ambitious. He wants to tackle America's problems head on, so you have to admire him for that. But he seems to have negative  about whole ethnic groups. You can't do that. He should be targeting the criminal's and drugs people in all USA communities. His ideas seem not to be thought threw and not workable or fair. But he certainly isn't boring!

The Holy Bible never say in anywhere that #Jesus is #God,

The devil was haven #Authority on Earth before #Jesus #Matt 4:1 to 11 but after his #Crucifixion and #Resurrection all #Authority in #Heaven and on #Earth has been given to him by #God the #Father #Matt 28:18  
Now #Jesus is #Lord in #Heaven and a #King on the whole #Earth 

While #God the #Holy #Father is #King of #Kings and #Lord of #Lords 

Now the devil as a ruler now on Earth has no Authority on us but can only deceive us to do Bad. The #Bible never lie just that we are all deceive by the Roman Empire with the Teachings ...
