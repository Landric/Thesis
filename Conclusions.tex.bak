\section{Conclusions}
\label{conclusionsfuture:conclusions}

\subsection{Findings}
Rhetoric and logic are both important aspects of online social argumentation; to accurately model how arguments occur and evolve across social media it is important to take into account all the techniques and tactics that are employed. While it is difficult to determine the value of a contribution, to define all logical contributions (and only logical contributions) as valuable is a naive approach. Being able to accurately record all aspects of argumentation on social media will be the first step towards being able to accurately analyse informal argument on an enormous scale. The work presented in this report provides a novel framework for modelling a subset of rhetorical argumentation, ideal for use in modelling social argumentation, and demonstrates some of the structures that may be observed observe when applied to three case studies. From these case studies, three major conclusions can be drawn. 

Firstly, and most importantly, rhetorical tactics are shown to be present throughout the argumentation in the case studies, even when only accounting for a small subset of rhetorical argumentation. Clearly, failure to accurately model these social argumentation strategies is detrimental to the goal of studying how discussions evolve on the social web.

Secondly, in the three use cases, rhetorical tactics are most often used by either those contributing the most to the discussion overall, or by those who do not contribute logically at all. This raises the interesting possibility of the potential to determine the quality of an argument based on the quantity of contributions (although, as discussed in Section \ref{aswo:results}, a logical contribution is not necessarily of higher value than a rhetorical contribution).

Finally, while the features of the argumentation structure above are challenging to detect automatically and expensive to manually annotate, the markers present in the social media sphere are relatively trivial to detect, and some correlations between the two can be observed.

\subsection{Limitations}
The primary limitation is the necessity to manually annotate all of the data. This is a time consuming and subjective process, but as yet there is no way to circumvent this process and automatically extract premises and conclusions. A further constraint is that only English-language sites are examined. There are, of course, many other social media services that cater to audiences of different languages, such as \textit{Renren}\footnote{http://renren.com/} for China or \textit{VKontakte}\footnote{http://vk.com/} for eastern Europe. However, this separation is mitigated by the fact that different languages (and different cultures) have their own rhetorical structures and argumentation schemes \citep[p.~21]{Van2004}. As a result, attempting to analyse multiple sites with different primary languages concurrently would distort any patterns that might emerge in the argument structure of the users.

\subsection{Contributions}
\TODO{Contributions: ASWO (based on AIF+ and SIOC) and the study of rhetorical vis logical argument in three case studies.}
%Bringing rhetorical and logical models of argumentation together for the social web has huge potential in terms of large-scale analysis, but also in terms of tools that could help communities manage argumentation, helping to solve diverse problems from trolling to groupthink. Our hope is that the initial work described in this paper will start discussion over the best ways of modelling eristic alongside logical argumentation, and draw attention to this important problem area.


\section{Future Work}
Based on the investigations that have been carried out, and the findings described in Section \ref{conclusionsfuture:conclusions}, there are three particular avenues of future work that could be approached, using this extended model of social argumentation at their core.

Firstly, as is the focus of many researchers in this field, attention can be given to the use of artificial intelligence and argumentation, whether by reasoning over a model of argument in an attempt to determine the most valid argument and subsequent course of action \citep{caminada2007} or by using the model to influence the techniques and strategies of intelligent agents involved in dialogue games \citep{Reed2008}. At present the weakness of this approach is that the model cannot, at this stage, be automatically constructed but must put together through a time and labour intensive process of manual annotation. Therefore, using the model as a basis of reasoning over argumentation in general is ultimately flawed. Any gains that were achieved in this area would be rendered moot by the cost of creating a model for every argumentation to be reasoned over, and rendered impractical on a web-scale. In addition, the eristic features of the model are unlikely to be practical (or appropriate) for the use of reasoning, or governing inter-agent negotiations.

With this in mind, the second avenue would be to generate this model from the arguments$_2$ themselves, by means of natural language processing \citep{palau2009}, the use of social machines \citep{hendler2010} or some combination thereof. This would go some way towards solving a large outstanding issue in the field \citep[p.~31-32]{Schneider2013}. While working towards a means of automatically generating the model has potential, it is likely that the social and eristic nature of the arguments to be modelled is the very thing that hinders this approach. Web-based culture and language is made up of many disparate groups, and continues to rapidly and constantly evolve, which renders current natural language processing impractical in the short term and ineffective in the long term, without the use of domain-specific normalisation techniques that are expensive or inaccurate \citep{han2011, eisenstein2013}. Clearly, at this stage, human input cannot be wholly eliminated. However, with the use of crowd-sourcing or social machines, the large effort cost of annotating arguments$_2$ could be distributed across participants to a manageable level.

Finally, emphasis could be placed on the social aspect of argument. Because argumentation is a social process conducted by people, it is important to recognise the fact that individuals may perceive the same argument$_2$ in many different ways due to cultural beliefs \citep{suzuki2011}, pre-existing cognitive biases \citep{Arceneaux2012}, as well as features surrounding the content of the argument$_1$ such as avatars \citep{lee2014}.
%By using the manually marked-up model of rhetorical features of argument as a unique case-study, it could be experimentally determined which features of argumentation consumers and creators of social media engage with the most.

The advantage of this approach is that it uses the existing model as a platform for experimentally evaluating how different argumentation tactics affect users' responses to arguments$_2$.
In this way, the existing model can be used as a means of analysing how users' perceptions of an argument$_2$ change with regard to a series of case studies. 

This contribution to the field can then be used to assist further work in a number of other areas, such as adaptive 
or the development of argumentation frameworks that integrate with the social web \citep{torroni2010}.

\subsection{Hypothesis}
\TODO{\textit{``The inclusion of rhetorical techniques in eristic argument on the social web affects the way in which users perceive and engage with the argument''}}

\TODO{Define:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Rhetorical techniques
\item eristic argument
\item perception
\item types of engagement
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Work Package 1a: Formalise Rhetorical Additions to Model}
\paragraph{Description:}
It has been shown in Section \ref{aswo:results} that rhetorical tactics, even when only considering a highly constrained subset, are prevalent throughout three case studies. Therefore, there is a clear need for expanding the capabilities of modelling such tactics, the relationships between them and how these integrate with the AIF and SIOC. To begin with, important rhetorical features would need to be determined and rigorously defined: an example of additions that could be made include the notion of meta-argumentation described in \ref{aswo:investigation:annotations} or of arguments$_1$ that actively pursues a particular call to action (rather than simply putting forward or advocating a position). These can then be incorporated as part of the ASWO.


\paragraph{Tasks:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Determine and define important rhetorical features of argumentation
\item Extend the ASWO with these additional tactics
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Outcome:} A formal ontology defining a broader subset of rhetorical tactics in social argumentation, and the relationships between them and the AIF and SIOC.

\paragraph{Estimated Time:}1 month

\subsection{Work Package 1b: Multi-Contributor Classification}
\paragraph{Description:}
Work package 1a addresses the need to further model rhetorical tactics used on social media. However, for the purposes of preparing an experiment investigating the result of these tactics on user perception, there is no need to exhaustively model all aspects of this form of argumentation (such as individual information nodes, or the relations between them). Instead, a simpler classification format can be developed, that focuses on categorising a broad range of tactics from a number of sources. 

Table \ref{table:annotations} shows an example of these potential classifications. By using non-exclusive categories, arguments$_1$ can be annotated as containing multiple tactics (the only exception to this is the ``other'' category which, by definition, is exclusive). These tactics are divided into fine-grained categories (such as logical support, transitions, meta-argumentation, etc.) and coarser-grained categories (such as logical tactics, rhetorical tactics and other).
In addition, reputation systems (such as up-votes etc.) will be tracked and \TODO{normalised across each social biome}.

To achieve this, annotators will be recruited and given basic training in differentiating between tactics. Each annotator will be required to mark up \TODO{determine a reasonable number each?} posts from \TODO{X} threads with overlap between annotators, to allow for consensus checking.

\TODO{Threads will be representative per biome} which allows for analysis to be performed on how rhetorical tactics are used in different areas of the social web.

This method allows for a larger breadth of samples, greater amounts of data to be marked up for future experiments and, by incorporating inter-rater reliability checks, removes potential subjectivity bias compared to a single annotator.

\paragraph{Tasks:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Recruit annotators
\item Conduct annotations
\item Check consensus/inter-rater reliability
\item Analyse data
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Outcome:} A dataset annotated with a broader sub-set of rhetorical tactics used in nine different argumentative discussions and an analysis of the uses of granular rhetorical tactics across different spheres of the social web.

\paragraph{Estimated Time:} 3 months


\subsection{Work Package 2a: Interpretation and Engagement Pilot}
\paragraph{Description:} To determine an appropriate bounding on the length of experiment and participant overload, a short informal pilot study will be conducted. This will aim to asses how the number of posts per thread affects the required time for participants to complete the study and the quality and quantity of responses.


\paragraph{Tasks:}

\item
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Outcome:} Appropriate weightings for participant load during the main experiment

\paragraph{Estimated Time:}2 months



\subsection{Work Package 2b: Interpretation and Engagement Study}
\paragraph{Description:}


To determine the effect of rhetorical techniques on the perception of eristic argumentation on the social web, a \TODO{within-participant} experiment will be conducted in which voluntary participants are shown the argumentation threads annotated in Work Package 1. Participants will be shown three different argumentation threads, each originating from a different social media platform, following the same topic. Threads will be ``pruned'' so that
\TODO{how to handle overlap (i.e. posts that contain both?): drop or keep?}

Participants will need to be a demographically distributed set of regular users of the social web. 
Datapoints per experimental factor ($D$) can be calculated from the number of threads shown to each participant ($T$), the number of participants ($N$), total tactic combinations ($C$) and the number of different social media biomes used ($B$) using the formula $D = \frac{T \times N}{C \times B}$

Given that the experiment is \TODO{within-participants}, $T=C$
This reduces the granularity of

Given the particular topic of discussion in the dataset, care must be taken to ensure that biases are identified during selection and accounted for during analysis of results. This can also be mitigated through use of a pre-test questionnaire to capture demographic data, topic interest and account for any biases -- due to the topic at hand, this may also require asking participants what they consider their political affiliations.

The majority of questions in the questionnaire itself will ask participants to rate their agreement with a series of statements on a Likert scale. The statements will include:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Overall, the debate seemed polite}
\item \textit{I found the debate informative}
\item \textit{I found the debate entertaining}
\item \textit{I would consider responding to this debate by replying with a comment of my own/voting on the comments/sharing the debate}
\end{itemize}



Such questions could be further supplemented with questions of the form \textit{Which user(s) did you find most informative? (Select up to three)}, \textit{Which user(s) did you find least polite? (Select up to three)} or \textit{Which user(s) did you feel had the most powerful argument? (Select up to three)}. This allows, to some degree, the examination of individual posts as well as the thread as a whole and might also highlight any biases towards certain users and/or points of view. ``Open-ended'' questions, such as \textit{What do you feel was the upshot of the debate?} will not be included due to the volume of data this would produce.

\TODO{Purpose/perception quiz? Likert-rated adjectives: Accurate, believable, biased, clear, comprehensive. factual, fair, informative, important, objective, persuasive, sensationalistic, well-written}
\citep{sundar2000}

The presentation of the arguments themselves will be in a uniform format, to avoid leading participants to make judgements based on the (perceived) culture of the original platform. Users' names will be semi-anonymised; real names will be removed, as will artefacts revealing the source site (such as the ``@'' prefix used on Twitter \TODO{from the posts as well?}), but screen names often give an insight to a users views and motivations \citep[p.~379]{cornetto2006} and while it is conceivable that a participant may have interacted with the user before it is sufficiently unlikely in practice to warrant their inclusion. The experiment itself will be run for a period of three months, which should be adequate time to accumulate the necessary participants, with sufficient additional time beforehand to prepare, and afterwards to analyse the results.

\TODO{Discuss results/analysis}


\paragraph{Tasks:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Plan/form questionnaire
\item Create experimental framework
\item Recruit participants
\item Carry out experiment
\item Analyse results
\item Write journal paper
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Outcome:} An analysis of the experiment, and a journal paper detailing the process and results.

\paragraph{Estimated Time:} 6 months

\subsection{Work Package 3: Write-up of Thesis}
