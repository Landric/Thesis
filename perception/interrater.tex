\subsection{Inter Rater Reliability}
\label{perception:results:interrater}
To gain an additional insight of how much agreement there was between participants, and if there was particularly strong areas of agreement or disagreement, the first and last statements shown were identical to all participants. These statements were selected at random from the sample pool, but were manually inspected to ensure they were non-empty and comprehensible (e.g., English-language).

The first post, taken from Reddit, reads as follows:
\textit{The FSA is also irrelevant. Nusra and/or ISIS would be be the rulers if Assad collapsed. And also, NO the ``FSA'' is mostly islamists, most of the ``secular rebels'' have switched around and have become part of the SDF which is part of the YPG.} This was annotated as having Information, and a Logical Attack. Table \ref{table:perception:first-raw} shows the raw answers that participants gave to the first question. In addition to these results, 10 people skipped this question. Table \ref{table:perception:first-averages} shows the distribution of these answers: while  there is a relatively large range between the minimum and maximum responses the standard deviation is not excessive. The largest value (1.218) was for the question \textit{This comment makes (or attempts to make) a persuasive argument.} The lowest values were for the questions exploring the perception of entertainment and credibility (0.764 and 0.899 respectively).

The last post, taken from Twitter, reads as follows:
\textit{@steve\_walke23 @guardian @lisaocarroll Some beings are inhuman - ISIS atrocities don't bother you? Get off your priggish high horse.} This was annotated as having Information and a Rhetorical Attack, directed against an Entity (in this case likely representing one of @steve\_walke23 or @lisaocarroll, or potentially both).

Table \ref{table:perception:last-raw} shows the raw answers that participants gave to the last question. In addition to these results, 2 people skipped this question. Because fewer people completed every question of the survey, dropping out before the total number of responses to these questions is lower than that of the first post.

Table \ref{table:perception:last-averages} shows the distribution of these answers. The standard deviations are not widely different from the responses to the first group of questions in scale, though they do differ by question. The largest value (1.159), lower than the highest standard deviation of the first group of questions, was shared by the questions examining participants reactions, specifically replying to and voting on.

The lowest values (0.840 and 0.904 respectively), higher than the lowest standard deviations of the first group of questions, were in response to the likelihood participants would reply to this comment (the majority were in agreement that they would not) and judging whether it was considered coherent (on average, participants found it neither excessively clear or unclear).
