  abstract = {We explore a framework for argumentation (based on classical logic)
	in which an argument is a pair where the first item in the pair is
	a minimal consistent set of formulae that proves the second item
	(which is a formula). We provide some basic definitions for arguments,
	and various kinds of counter-arguments (defeaters). This leads us
	to the definition of canonical undercuts which we argue are the only
	defeaters that we need to take into account. We then motivate and
	formalise the notion of argument trees and argument structures which
	provide a way of exhaustively collating arguments and counter-arguments.
	We use argument structures as the basis of our general proposal for
	argument aggregation. There are a number of frameworks for modelling
	argumentation in logic. They incorporate formal representation of
	individual arguments and techniques for comparing conflicting arguments.
	In these frameworks, if there are a number of arguments for and against
	a particular conclusion, an aggregation function determines whether
	the conclusion is taken to hold. We propose a generalisation of these
	frameworks. In particular, our new framework makes it possible to
	define aggregation functions that are sensitive to the number of
	arguments for or against. We compare our framework with a number
	of other types of argument systems, and finally discuss an application
	in reasoning with structured news reports.},

	which the members of an online communityâ€“a feminist web-based discussion

	and the targeted group largely ineffectual in responding to his attack,
	as a means to understand how such behavior might be minimized and
	managed in general. The analysis further suggests that feminist and
	other nonmainstream online forums are especially vulnerable, in that
	they must balance inclusive ideals against the need for protection
	and safety, a tension that can be exploited by disruptive elements
	to generate intragroup conflict.},

	over contested issues. We argue that a perspective supported by semiotic
	and cognitively oriented discourse analyses offers both theoretical
	insights and motivates representational requirements for the semantics
	of tools for contesting meaning. We introduce our semiotic approach,
	highlighting its implications for discourse representation, before
	describing a research system (ClaiMaker) designed to support the
	construction of scholarly argumentation by allowing analysts to publish
	and contest â€˜claimsâ€™ about scientific contributions. We show
	how ClaiMaker's representational scheme is grounded in specific assumptions
	concerning the nature of explicit modelling, and the evolution of
	meaning within a discourse community. These characteristics allow
	the system to represent scholarly discourse as a dynamic process,
	in the form of continuously evolving structures. A cognitively oriented
	discourse analysis then shows how the use of a small set of cognitive
	relational primitives in the underlying ontology opens possibilities
	for offering users advanced forms of computational service for analysing
	collectively constructed argumentation networks.},

	another. The content, timing, and frequency of the social media-based
	conversations occurring between consumers are outside managersâ€™
	direct control. This stands in contrast to the traditional integrated
	marketing communications paradigm whereby a high degree of control
	is present. Therefore, managers must learn to shape consumer discussions
	in a manner that is consistent with the organization's mission and
	performance goals. Methods by which this can be accomplished are
	delineated herein. They include providing consumers with networking
	platforms, and using blogs, social media tools, and promotional tools

  month = jul,
  abstract = {The rise of the "information society" offers not only considerable
	peril but also great promise. Beset from all sides by a never-ending
	barrage of media, how can we ensure that the most accurate information
	emerges and is heeded? In this book, Cass R. Sunstein develops a
	deeply optimistic understanding of the human potential to pool information,
	and to use that knowledge to improve our lives. In an age of information
	overload, it is easy to fall back on our own prejudices and insulate
	ourselves with comforting opinions that reaffirm our core beliefs.
	Crowds quickly become mobs. The justification for the Iraq war, the
	collapse of Enron, the explosion of the space shuttle Columbia--all
	of these resulted from decisions made by leaders and groups trapped
	in "information cocoons," shielded from information at odds with
	their preconceptions. How can leaders and ordinary people challenge
	insular decision making and gain access to the sum of human knowledge?
	Stunning new ways to share and aggregate information, many Internet-based,
	are helping companies, schools, governments, and individuals not
	only to acquire, but also to create, ever-growing bodies of accurate
	knowledge. Through a ceaseless flurry of self-correcting exchanges,
	wikis, covering everything from politics and business plans to sports
	and science fiction subcultures, amass--and refine--information.
	Open-source software enables large numbers of people to participate
	in technological development. Prediction markets aggregate information
	in a way that allows companies, ranging from computer manufacturers
	to Hollywood studios, to make better decisions about product launches
	and office openings. Sunstein shows how people can assimilate aggregated
	information without succumbing to the dangers of the herd mentality--and
	when and why the new aggregation techniques are so astoundingly accurate.
	In a world where opinion and anecdote increasingly compete on equal
	footing with hard evidence, the on-line effort of many minds coming
	together might well provide the best path to infotopia.},

  abstract = {A cumulative body of experimental research is emerging that examines
	the ability of computer technology to support the processes and outcomes
	of small group meetings. For the most part the group decision support
	system effort has been concerned with demonstrating the usefulness
	of the technology in planning and decision-making situations where
	the quality of the meeting's outcomes can be objectively assessed.
	In many decision situations, however, there is no objective measure
	of decision quality available. Rather, the group must reconcile differences
	in opinion, personal preference, or judgment and achieve consensus
	about a particular mode of action. As a contribution to the accumulating
	research on GDSS, the current study examines the effects of a GDSS
	in resolving conflicts of personal preference. In a task requiring
	resolution of competing personal preferences, 82 groups-the largest
	sample size in the GDSS literature to date-were randomly assigned
	to one of three experiment conditions: (1) a computer-based support
	system (GDSS); (2) a manual, paper and pencil, support system; or
	(3) no support whatsoever. Groups were either of size 3 or 4 persons.
	Use of the GDSS was expected to facilitate democratic participation
	in group discussion, move group members toward agreement with one
	another, and result in a high level of satisfaction with the group
	decision process. While several of the intended effects of the technology
	were observed, the groups experienced some unintended consequences
	as a result of using the GDSS. In general, the GDSS technology appeared
	to offer some advantage over no support, but little advantage over
	the pencil and paper method of supporting group discussion.},

	Support for Natural Crisis Management}},
  abstract = {A core issue in crisis management is to extract from the mass of incoming
	information what is important for situational awareness during mass
	emergencies. Based on a case study we develop a prototypical application,
	TweetComp1, which is integrated into the decision-support component
	of a Tsunami early warning system and demonstrates the applicability
	of our approach. This paper describes four novel approaches using
	focused twitter crawling, trustworthiness analysis, location analysis/geo-parsing,
	and multilingual tweet classification in the context of how they
	could be used for monitoring crises. The validity of our state-of-the
	art text mining and network analysis technologies will be verified
	in different experiments based on a human annotated gold standard
	corpus},
