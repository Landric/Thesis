\chapter{Perception of Rhetorical Tactics in Individual Comments}
\label{perception}

This chapter examines how the different types of argument discussed in the previous chapter are perceived by their audience. An experiment was carried out in which participants were shown a number of social media posts, and asked a series of questions (answerable on a Likert scale) about each one. These questions gauged both how they felt about the post (e.g. entertained or offended), and how they would act on it (e.g. replying or reporting).


\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Data Sample}
\label{perception:method:sample}

This work used the ``normal'' threads acquired in Section \ref{case:method:sample}.

Each of these ``normal'' threads was then annotated by topic, using one of the following categories based on an aggregation of the topics provided by the five news distribution sites the social media accounts of which the stories were sourced from:
\textit{Current Events}, stories covering recent or ongoing occurrences;
\textit{Business}, stories involving businesses and/or the economy;
\textit{Politics}, stories relating to politics, politicians, elections, etc.;
\textit{Science \& Technology}, stories relating to science, the environment, new technologies, etc.;
\textit{Entertainment \& Arts}, stories involving cultural events, celebrities, etc.;
\textit{Sports}, stories covering sporting events and participants;
and \textit{Features}, stories that form an opinion piece, or focus on an individual rather than the broader story they are a part of.

\subsection{Classifications}

\TODO{Argument}

\TODO{Social} 
 \citet{kietzmann2011social} describe seven
Identity, Sharing, Presence, Relationships, Reputation, Groups, and Conversations



Table \ref{table:perception:questions} summarises each of these classifications, and provides justification for their inclusion.

\subsection{Participants and Survey}
Participants were invited via a general call on social media; they were provided an information sheet and consent form, and asked to confirm that they were above the age of eighteen. Participants were shown a selection eighteen posts taken from the sample described in Section \ref{perception:method:sample} (three different news-types across three social media platforms). For context, they were also show the initial post in the thread and, if present, any post that was directly replied to by the target. These were presented to participants via a web-survey, a screenshot of which is shown in Figure \ref{figure:perception:survey}.

\end{figure}

Every participant was also shown, and asked to rate, two additional posts common to all participants to judge the overall inter-rater agreement. These were selected at random from the sampled pool of comments and manually inspected to ensure they were non-empty and comprehensible (e.g., English-language).

\section{Data Analysis and Results}

\subsection{Raw Data}

Table \ref{table:perception:breakdown} shows the raw answers that participants gave to the questions overall. Even here, it is relatively easy to see (from questions 6-9) that the majority of people would not be inclined to interact or engage with the comments that were presented here. In addition to these results, 45 people skipped this question

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Breakdown of answers given for each question}
\label{table:perception:breakdown}
\begin{tabular}{ p{6cm} | r | r | r | r | r }
\textbf{Question} & \textbf{1} &  \textbf{2} &  \textbf{3} &  \textbf{4} &  \textbf{5}\\
\hline
This comment is coherent/easy to understand  &  48 & 134 & 71 & 374 & 119 \\
\hline
This comment contains (or appears to contain) credible information  &  127 & 230 & 224 & 133 & 32 \\

\hline
Would you be more or less likely to reply to this comment than average?  &  232 & 216 & 183 & 108 & 7 \\
\hline
Would you be more or less likely to share this comment (to friends/followers/etc.) than average?  &  291 & 226 & 176 & 51 & 2 \\
\hline
Would you be more or less likely to up-/down-vote this comment than average?  &  207 & 179 & 195 & 143 & 22 \\
\hline
Would you be more or less likely to report this comment than average?  &  296 & 204 & 211 & 30 & 5 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


Table \ref{table:perception:annotation-breakdown} shows the number of responses given per each different annotation type. Note that as a post may have multiple annotations, there may be (and is likely to be) overlap in the number of responses. From this we can see the distribution of annotations, combined with random selection and the ability of participants to skip questions, resulted in only one response for the \textit{Spam/Advertisement} category, and only two for the \textit{Preference} category. However, posts annotated as containing Logical Attack/Support and Rhetorical Attack/Support, the key element of this perception study, received over one hundred responses each.

\subsection{Comparison to Existing Work}
\TODO{Comparisons}

\section{Summary}
Due to a relatively high standard deviation, the results point to a degree of variation between participants answers. This is likely due to a combination of factors, in particular the individual variance of the posts (in terms of tone, implicit meaning, context, etc.) and the natural subjectivity with which people view argument. Despite this, the results suggest that rhetorical techniques are considered very similar to logical techniques in terms of general perception of argumentation, and are often considered to be more entertaining. This supports the hypothesis that rhetorical argumentation has its place in discussions on the social web, and is valuable to model.
